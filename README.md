## Concepts
- ü§ù Screaming Architecture
- üìÑ Layered Architecture
- ‚ö° Reactive data-modeling
- üå± Structured react-query

## Supabase init
This starter uses supabase only for authentication; you will need to initialize a project on supabase and pick up the PUBLIC URL and ANON KEY.

Go inside your project on supabase > settings > api > Project url (PUBLIC_URL)

Go inside your project on supabase > settings > api > Project api keys > anon public (ANON KEY)

## Supabase setup

- Need to disable sign-up confirm e-mail (go to: Authentication > Providers > Mail)
If you enable emailing with the default supabase provider, some speed-limiting errors may occur, the advice is to use a gmail provider for free projects.
- Currently the supabase token automatically updates.

## Architecture
The architecture remains true to the old paradigm, according to which the responsibility for ‚Äúactions‚Äù lies with the client, so this repo does not follow the new conventions with component-server and action-server.

The project follows a layered architecture, taking advantage of react-query, it will never manipulate the actual data on the api calls, but will call entity handlers, which will have the real api calls inside them; note that even the real 'requesters' do not call the api directly, there is a basic handler that does it for them.

Form management is completely based on the solution proposed by ShadCN, which uses react-form and zod for validation.

Within the project we try to use Screaming Architecture as much as possible, highlighting the names of individual directories and, where possible, individual files.
